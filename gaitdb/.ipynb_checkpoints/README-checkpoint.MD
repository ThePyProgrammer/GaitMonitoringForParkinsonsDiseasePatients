### Data Description

Walking stride interval time series included are from 15 subjects: 5 healthy young adults (23 - 29 years old), 5 healthy old adults (71 - 77 years old), and 5 older adults (60 - 77 years old) with Parkinson's disease. The file name indicates old (o), young (y) or Parkinson's disease (pd). For the old and young subjects, the age (in years) is also included in the filename.

Subjects walked continuously on level ground around an obstacle-free path. The stride interval was measured using ultra-thin, force sensitive resistors placed inside the shoe. The analog force signal was sampled at 300 Hz with a 12 bit A/D converter, using an ambulatory, ankle-worn microcomputer that also recorded the data. Subsequently, the time between foot-strikes was automatically computed. The method for determining the stride interval is a modification of a previously validated method that has been shown to agree with force-platform measures, a “gold” standard.

Data were collected from the healthy subjects as they walked in a roughly circular path for 15 minutes, and from the subjects with Parkinson’s disease as they walked for 6 minutes up and down a long hallway.
