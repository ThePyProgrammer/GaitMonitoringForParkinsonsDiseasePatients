# Singapore Science Mentorship Programme (SMP) 26<sup>th</sup> Youth Science Conference (YSC)

The SMP is an external mentorship programme that is organised by the Gifted Education Branch (GEB), Ministry of Education (MOE), Singapore. Under this programme, students get the opportunity to work on research works with MOE’s partner institutions such as the polytechnics, Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA), Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC), Institute of Infocomm Research (I2R), A*STAR, College of Engineering, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), National University of Singapore (NUS) and Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD).

This is a golden opportunity for the young and aspiring researchers to embark on a meaningful research programme. It is quite competitive to get into this programme but you would not want to miss it!

## Submission

### SMP Research Paper

All teams are required to submit a SMP research paper for the research study conducted under SMP. You should adhere to the attached guidelines and use the research template provided when preparing the report. Teams will be asked to re-submit their research papers if the format is incorrect or risk not having their papers featured in the YSC proceedings.


**The final draft of your research paper is due to be submitted to your mentor(s) for final vetting by 4 Jan 2021.** If your team requires more time, you should seek your mentor’s permission to submit it later. However, your team should factor in adequate time for your mentor(s) to vet and provide feedback and for your team to make the final edits.


Your mentor(s) will submit the confirmed papers to their institution coordinators for collation and submission to the MOE.

#### <ins>Guidelines for SMP Research Report</ins>

The research paper should be type-written in **Times New Roman**:

- font size **13** and **bold for the title**
- font size **12 for the main body text**, with **single line spacing** and **1 inch margins** throughout.

A template for the research paper is available [here](https://sites.google.com/site/scimphome/event-notes-forms-and-templates).

The length of the research paper should not exceed **9** pages including diagrams, tables and graphs but excluding references and appendices.

The final draft of the research paper (soft copy in **MS Word format**) must be **submitted to your mentor by 4 Jan 2021**. Mentors will vet and submit the papers to institution coordinators for clearance and collation thereafter. The approved research paper will be submitted to Gifted Education Branch (GEB), SMP Committee by **22 Jan 2021**. *Research papers submitted directly by students to GEB will not be accepted.*



### Video Presentation

In lieu of a hard copy poster, all SMP teams will be required to produce a video presentation of your project. The video presentation will be showcased on the 26<sup>th</sup> Youth Science Conference e-exhibition platform. 


Do adhere to the guidelines provided so that they meet the requirements to be showcased on the e-exhibition platform.

#### <ins>Guidelines for Video Submission</ins>

Each project team are required to prepare a video presentation of their SMP project. The video presentation **should not exceed 10 minutes**.


The content of the video presentation should parallel the organisation of the research study. In general, it should include:
- a brief introduction along with the research aim(s)
- literature review and its relevance to your group’s project
- methods used in your research project
- analysis of results, with emphasis on significant findings or recommended course of action
- limitations in the study and how the team managed them
- conclusion of the research by summarising key findings and implications
- future direction (if any)


Teams should submit a link to their video recording, with the following settings, to their SMP teacher coordinator by the stipulated deadline as determined by your school coordinator.
- videos to be saved in **mp4 format, at 720p or higher**
- videos should be saved in either Google Drive or Dropbox, with a downloadable link


Teams could consider using one of the following recording options to produce the video presentations:
- Using PowerPoint *Record Slide Show* function where presenters can narrate over the PowerPoint slides and save the file as .mp4 format
- Using Recording function in Zoom
- Use a recording app (e.g. Loom) to carry out the recordings


The video presentations will be featured in the e-exhibition for the 26th Youth Science Conference, as well as used for Project e-Presentation with a panel of scientists who will be engaging teams in a Q&A session.

---

Your research paper and video presentation will be shared with the panel of scientists 2 weeks prior to your Project Presentation Session.
