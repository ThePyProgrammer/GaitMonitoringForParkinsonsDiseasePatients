This project was submitted in for multiple fairs and conferences. Here, I provide a quick overview:

## 13<sup>th</sup> International Science Youth Forum Digital 2021 (ISYF<i>digital</i> 2021)
organised by Hwa Chong Institution (HCI), Singapore.

### Objectives

ISYFdigital 2021 will be conducted fully online. As in previous years, it is a rare and valuable platform for eminent scientists to interact and share ideas with young budding science and mathematics talents. The following are the key objectives for the 2021 online Forum:

1. _<ins>Inspire Passion for Science Research amongst Youth.</ins> ISYF aims to provide high-ability students with ample opportunities to share and discuss their interest in science and science research. They will be exposed to many fields of science which will broaden their outlook and understanding of the scientific world. Eminent scientists will inspire them through stories of their own life experiences and scientific discoveries. These interactions are helpful for the youths especially when they are considering pursuing science as a meaningful and fulfilling endeavour._
2. _<ins>Establish Co-operation and Friendship amongst Young Science Talents.</ins> Students will have many opportunities to interact in different cross-cultural groups and form strong bonds with each other throughout the Forum. Activities are designed to promote mutual cooperation, understanding and appreciation of each other’s diverse culture yet sharing a common passion in science and research._

## Singapore Science Mentorship Programme (SMP) 26<sup>th</sup> Youth Science Conference (YSC)

The SMP is an external mentorship programme that is organised by the Gifted Education Branch (GEB), Ministry of Education (MOE), Singapore. Under this programme, students get the opportunity to work on research works with MOE’s partner institutions such as the polytechnics, Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA), Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC), Institute of Infocomm Research (I2R), A*STAR, College of Engineering, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), National University of Singapore (NUS) and Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD).

This is a golden opportunity for the young and aspiring researchers to embark on a meaningful research programme. It is quite competitive to get into this programme but you would not want to miss it!
