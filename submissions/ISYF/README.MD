# 13th International Science Youth Formum Digital 2021 (ISYF<i>digital</i> 2021)
organised by Hwa Chong Institution (HCI), Singapore.

## Objectives

ISYFdigital 2021 will be conducted fully online. As in previous years, it is a rare and valuable platform for eminent scientists to interact and share ideas with young budding science and mathematics talents. The following are the key objectives for the 2021 online Forum:

1. _<ins>Inspire Passion for Science Research amongst Youth.</ins> ISYF aims to provide high-ability students with ample opportunities to share and discuss their interest in science and science research. They will be exposed to many fields of science which will broaden their outlook and understanding of the scientific world. Eminent scientists will inspire them through stories of their own life experiences and scientific discoveries. These interactions are helpful for the youths especially when they are considering pursuing science as a meaningful and fulfilling endeavour._
2. _<ins>Establish Co-operation and Friendship amongst Young Science Talents.</ins> Students will have many opportunities to interact in different cross-cultural groups and form strong bonds with each other throughout the Forum. Activities are designed to promote mutual cooperation, understanding and appreciation of each other’s diverse culture yet sharing a common passion in science and research._


## Selection Criteria

Given the intellectual rigour of the programme, where students will interact with scientists and share their own research experience (through the online research poster sharing), the Forum targets top Science students from schools all over the world. To ensure that delegates benefit fully from the experience, the <ins>**three**</ins> Science students representing your school should: 

1. Be Sec 4 (IP Year 4) students in 2021;
2. Be within the top tier of their respective Science cohorts;
3. Have substantial experience in science research or competitions;
4. Possess good oral proficiency in English;
5. Possess enthusiasm and strong interest in forging ties with fellow students from all over the world;
6. (In 2021) Have access to stable internet connection and a working computer with webcam and microphone, for a full experience of the online conference.
