## Submission - Project Poster and Grading
We will need to prepare an AO size project poster for the above project. At RC2021, organisers will provide project panel space for us to put up your poster. Graders (NUSH teachers) will be assigned to grade your projects at RC2021 on 24<sup>th</sup> Feb 2021 Wed. We will need to be at our posters for this purpose.

## Note
All research endeavours need to be graded internally in school in order to be recorded in a studentâ€™s research transcript. This is an important document that a student gets at graduation. RC2021 offers the best platform for projects to be graded internally in school.

(Project grading at RC2021 is a totally separate matter from your participation in other competitive science fairs e.g. SSEF, SISC etc)
