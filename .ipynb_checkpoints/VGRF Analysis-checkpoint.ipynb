    "# Gait Monitoring for Parkinson's Disease Patients\n",
    "**Mentor**: Arthur Tay\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Description\n",
    "The objective of this project is to monitor the gait patterns for people with Parkinson Disease. We will analyse the gait for PD patients during freezing and non-freezing (normal) events. Various parameters (e.g. cadence, step lengths, stride lengths, etc) related to gait will be derived from motion sensors (accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers) using public datasets of PD patients. We will then investigate which of these parameters is most suitable for classification for freezing of gait in PD patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Product\n",
    "To make use of signal processing algorithms in extracting gait parameters from motion sensors and identifying most suitable parameters for classification of freezing of gait in PD patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "Students will first need to review and understands how to extract gait parameters from motion sensors. There are different algorithms in the literature and they will need to investigate which is most suitable. They will then make use of a PD patient public dataset to test out their methods. If time permits, they will learn basic machine learning tools for classification.\n",

    "### Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common movement disorders, affecting approximately 1 million Americans (estimates range between 4 and 6.5 million people worldwide) and about 1% of older adults. In the US alone, 60,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. PD is a chronic and progressive neurological disorder that results in tremor, rigidity, slowness, and postural instability. A disturbed gait is a common, debilitating symptom; patients with severe gait disturbances are prone to falls and may lose their functional independence.\n",
    "\n",
    "This database contains measures of gait from 93 patients with idiopathic PD (mean age: 66.3 years; 63% men), and 73 healthy controls (mean age: 66.3 years; 55% men). The database includes the vertical ground reaction force records of subjects as they walked at their usual, self-selected pace for approximately 2 minutes on level ground. Underneath each foot were 8 sensors ([Ultraflex Computer Dyno Graphy, Infotronic Inc.](http://www.infotronic.nl/#CDG)) that measure force (in Newtons) as a function of time. The output of each of these 16 sensors has been digitized and recorded at 100 samples per second, and the records also include two signals that reflect the sum of the 8 sensor outputs for each foot. For details about the format of the data, please see [this note](https://physionet.org/content/gaitpdb/1.0.0/format.txt).\n",
    "\n",
    "With this information, one can investigate the force record as a function of time and location, derive measures that reflect the center-of-pressure as a function of time, and determine timing measures (e.g., stride time, swing time) for each foot as functions of time. Thus, one can study the stride-to-stride dynamics and the variability of these time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "This database also includes demographic information, measures of disease severity (i.e., using the Hoehn & Yahr staging and/or the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale) and other related measures (available in HTML or xls spreadsheet format).\n",
    "\n",
    "A subset of the database includes measures recorded as subjects performed a second task (serial 7 subtractions) while walking, as in the figure above, which shows excerpts of swing time series from a patient with PD (lower panels) and a control subject (upper panels), under usual walking conditions (at left) and when performing serial 7 subtractions (at right). Under usual walking conditions, variability is larger in the patient with PD (Coefficient of Variation = 2.7%), compared to the control subject (CV = 1.3%). Variability increases during dual tasking in the subject with PD (CV = 6.5%), but not in the control subject (CV = 1.2%). From Yogev et al. (reference [4] below).\n",
